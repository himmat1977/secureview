# Mockups Folder

## Instructions
1. Paste all your design mockups here
2. Organize them by screen name (e.g., `login-screen.png`, `home-screen.jpg`)
3. Use clear naming conventions for easy reference

## Naming Convention
Use this format for mockup files:
- `[screen-name]-[variant].png`

Examples:
- `login-main.png`
- `home-dashboard.png`
- `profile-edit.png`
- `settings-main.png`

## Supported Formats
- PNG (preferred for UI mockups)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG (for icons and vectors)
- PDF (for multi-page designs)
- Figma/Sketch links (document them in a separate file)

## Next Steps
Once you add mockups here, we'll work on implementing each screen one by one.
